# Ethernet_Physical_layer
IN PHYSICAL LAYER THE ETHERNET PACKETS ARE DIVIDED INTO 8 BYTES THAT PASSES THROUGH A 64/66B ENCODER THAT OUPUT THE ENCODED 66 BITS REPRESENTATION OF THOSE 8 BYTS BLOCKS , 4X66 BITS BLOCKS WILL PASS THROUGH TRANSCODER BLOCK AND WILL BE CONVERTED INTO 257 BITS BLOCK, THOSE 66 BITS ARE TRANSMITTED OVER 4 PARALLEL PATHS CALLED LANES WITH ALIGNMENT MARKERS
